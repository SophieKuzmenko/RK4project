This project is dedicated to implementing the classical Runge-Kutta method of order 4, also known as RK4,<br />
in the numeric computing environment MATLAB.<br />
That includes:
1. Function, that solves a linear m-th order differential equation using RK4 method (P2Z45_SKU_rungekutty4order.m and countfunction.m)
2. Test, that checks the order of a total accumulated error ( test.m, helper_test.m, plotter_test.m)
